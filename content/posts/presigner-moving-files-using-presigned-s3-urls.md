Server administrators frequently have a hard problem with regards to moving files. As much as people like to discuss the future of DevOps and how all servers will be provisioned from code, some people still have servers that are pets. It can frequently be difficult to transfer files from one system to another when those systems are on different networks or different data centers. Presigner aims to solve this problem by using presigned AWS S3 links for downloading and uploading files with curl. Presigned links are links where the credentials have been encoded into the link for a limited time using cryptography.

```
> presigner s3://bucket_here/file_here.tar
https://bucket_here.s3.amazonaws.com/file_here.tar?X-Amz-Signature=18424ca80001a1b88cfe402cbe2395c47cf24a36ca121d11f53d04d4186e1369&X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=AKIAIRPW5JGRSXEQSOQQ/20191112/us-east-1/s3/aws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20191112T150506Z&X-Amz-Expires=21600&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host
```

These urls include all the authentication needed to GET/PUT files from AWS S3 so that they can safely be made on one system and then transferred via copy/paste, ssh, or shortlinks to a remote system. As long as the destinstion systems can access S3 over the network, this works for file transfers. 

This means that you are able to generate links on system A, use those links to upload files on system B, and download them on system C, but the credentials never have to leave system A. All this requires is a simple S3 bucket and permissions to use it. 

Quick tip, we have a bucket called `***-dropbox` which is set to expire everything in seven days. We use this for a lot of one-off transfers.

Presigner can support uploads/downloads with the `-v` flag, so `-v PUT` or `-v GET`. It will also make the curl command for you with the `-c` command if you are extra lazy like me. You can adjust the lifetime of the link time with `-d` although it has a max cap of 7 days at the moment due to an AWS limitation. It will also try and fetch the region given the bucket name but if you are running it in bulk or know the region in advance you can speed it up with `-r us-east-1` or equivalent.

You can get the source code for it and binaries from <https://github.com/UnrealAkama/presigner>
